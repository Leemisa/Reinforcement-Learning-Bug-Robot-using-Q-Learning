# 🤖 Reinforcement-Learning-Bug-Robot-using-Q-Learning

## 📝 Project Overview
This project explores reinforcement learning using a **LEGO Spike Education Kit**. The goal is to build and program a small robot(BUG) that learns to move forward optimally using the **Q-learning algorithm**. The robot acts as an intelligent agent—perceiving its environment, taking actions, and improving its behavior through feedback.

The following will be implemented designing, running, and evaluating multiple experiments, analyzing how learning performance changes with increased environmental complexity.

## ⚙️ Project Tasks

### Experimental Design and Setup

#### 1️⃣ Robot Construction
- Assemble a LEGO Spike robot with a basic movement function (e.g., two wheels).  
- Attach at least one sensor (e.g., ultrasonic, color, or distance sensor).  

#### 2️⃣ Programming
Implement **Q-learning** in your robot program. Define and document:  
- **State space** — measurable environmental conditions.  
- **Action space** — possible robot moves (e.g., forward, left, right).  
- **Reward function** — feedback for success or failure in each step.  

#### 3️⃣ Experimental Procedure
Conduct three experiments with progressive complexity:  
1. Experiment 1: Simple surface, small state-action space.  
2. Experiment 2: Varied surfaces, expanded state-action space.  
3. Experiment 3: Environment with obstacles or uneven terrain.  

Run each experiment across multiple learning episodes until behavior stabilizes.  

#### 4️⃣ Data Collection
Record for each experiment:  
- 🎥 Video clips of robot learning behavior.  
- 📊 Metrics — number of episodes, convergence time, and cumulative rewards.  
- 📈 Graphs comparing performance across experiments.
